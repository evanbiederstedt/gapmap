## Functions for Drawing Gapped Cluster Heatmap with ggplot2

This is a forked repo from gapmap version 0.0.3, which was removed from CRAN in 2020. The original sourcecode by the author Ryo Sakai can be found on Bitbucket [here](https://bitbucket.org/vda-lab/gapmap). 

I simply fixed the error, and re-submitted to CRAN with version 0.1.0.
